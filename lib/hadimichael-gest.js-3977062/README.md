#USAGE

##Include the library (gest.js)
You will need to include the 'gest.js' library using something like:

<code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="gest.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>

##Start gesture detection
You can start gest.js by calling:
<code>gest.start();</code>

##Listen for recognised gestures

### Method 1 (recommended)
Use the <code>.options.subscribeWithCallback(...)</code> function to listen for gestures:
<pre><code>gest.options.subscribeWithCallback(function(gesture) {
	//handle gesture .direction .up .down .left .right .error
});
</code></pre>
This method is recommended because it will automatically handle cross-browser event handling.

### Method 2
You can register an event listener on the <code>document</code> for <code>gest</code> using:
<pre><code>document.addEventListener('gest', function(gesture) {
	//handle gesture .direction .up .down .left .right .error
}, false);
</code></pre>

##How to handle recognised gestures
On every event, you will be passed a <code>gesture</code> object that contains:

- <code>.direction</code> the recognised gesture in words as a string
- <code>.up</code> boolean, true if the recognised gesture is up
- <code>.down</code> boolean, true if the recognised gesture is down
- <code>.left</code> boolean, true if the recognised gesture is left
- <code>.right</code> boolean, true if the recognised gesture is right
- <code>.error</code> an error object with...
	- <code>.code</code> a code as an int
	- <code>.message</code> and a message as a string

##Stop gesture detection
You can stop gest.js at any time by calling:
<code>gest.stop();</code>

##Using Options

###Sensitivity (80 by default)
You can specify the degree of colour change that should be used to determine whether or not a pixel has changed. The specified value should range from 0-100, with 100 implying that the slightest change should be enough. You can specify sensitivity using: <code>gest.options.sensitivity(85);</code>

###Skin Filtering (off by default)
To improve recognition in bright lighting conditions, you can enable HSV skin filtering using: <code>gest.options.skinFilter(true);</code>

###Debugging (off by default)
In order to view the video stream and enable <code>console.log(â€¦)</code> messages, you will need to toggle debugging using: <code>gest.options.debug(true);</code>

#WHAT'S CHANGED

##v0.5.0 (latest)

- Firefox support (woohoo!)
- Error handling, all the way back to the stone-age (IE7)
- Better event handling
- Ability for the developer to define sensitivity
- A new <code>.options.subscribeWithCallback(...)</code> function
- On screen messages is now DEPRECATED. I decided that this is something that the front-end developer should build - it shouldn't be part of the library. If you really want it back, check demo/simple.
- Locking is now DEPRECATED. It wasn't an elegant enough solution. It might come back in future releases...

#TODO
- bespoke.js plugin (this is pretty much done, I just need to package it up)
- Fine tune skin filtering values
- Include a ready flag... might do this, not sure yet.
- Bring back the ready message: "The force is strong with you, go forth and gesture."
